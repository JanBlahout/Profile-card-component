- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

```css
.bg-top {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  transform: translate(-25%, -50%);
  z-index: -1;
}

.profile-img {
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, 50%);
  border: 5px solid #fff;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```

### Continued development

I have to focus more on positioning of divs.
I think I could have solved better the stats section at the bottom of the card.

Also I dont know how to make the images in top left and bottom right corner scale down with the window
